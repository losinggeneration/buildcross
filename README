This project is to assist in building various cross compilers:
Fully supported cross compilers are that should build and work correctly:
* Dreamcast (sh-elf and arm-elf for KOS)
* Dreamcast Linux (sh4-linux-uclibc or sh4-linux-gnu)
* Gamecube (builds pretty much the same compiler as devkitpro)
* Gamecube Linux (powerpc-gekko-linux-uclibc or powerpc-gekko-linux-gnu)

Others that may or maynot work:
* Genesis
* Saturn
* ArchLinux PPC
* Arm Linux
* GBA
* Ix86

Usage:
The help should give most of the info needed to get started
./buildcross.sh -h
And this will give even more info and examples
./buildcross -e

Some highlights:
Build the Dreamcast compiler:
./buildcross.sh -dc
Build the Gamecube compiler:
./buildcross.sh gamecube -all
Build a Dreamcast Linux compiler with glibc:
./buildcross.sh -dcl
Build a Dreamcast Linux compiler with uclibc:
./buildcross.sh -u -dcl

Same as above but using the system name
Build a Dreamcast Linux compiler with glibc:
./buildcross.sh dclinux -bl
Build a Dreamcast Linux compiler with uclibc:
./buildcross.sh -u dclinux -dcl
