Version 1.0:
	-Initial release.

Version 1.1:
	-Some KOS fix-ups for generating the environ.sh file.

Version 1.2:
	-Added this file.
	-Changed the export PATH in Setup to include the newly installed
	 compiler first to use that instead of one that might be installed in a
	 path before that one.
	-Added support to try and use a cross compiler. I haven't been able to
	 get this to compile, but I don't think it's the scripts fault.
	-Added a way to check if the file was interrupted during untaring or
	 not.
	-Added support for using custom CFLAGS if you'd like.
	-Added config.guess which buildcross.sh uses to change --build on
	 cross-compiles so gcc doesn't try setting build equal to host.
	-Added checks to see if each is already configured/installed or not.
	 This also fixes when gcc final is built so it doesn't remove the
	 contents if it's configured to build already.

Version 1.3:
	-Added support for downloading sources if they aren't here instead of
	 just quitting. Still quits if unable to downlad files like one would
	 expect. Wget is needed for downloading Binutils, Gcc, and NewLib. SVN
	 is needed for getting KOS.
	-Moved some things around for easier reading of the code.
	-Added some comment formatting to make important comments stick out.
	-Changed some things about how kos is built. It also builds ports.
	-Added ix86 target.
	-KOS is built with the -dc command now
