Version 1.0:
	-Initial release.

Version 1.1:
	-Some KOS fix-ups for generating the environ.sh file.

Version 1.2:
	-Added this file.
	-Changed the export PATH in Setup to include the newly installed
	 compiler first to use that instead of one that might be installed in a
	 path before that one.
	-Added support to try and use a cross compiler. I haven't been able to
	 get this to compile, but I don't think it's the scripts fault.
	-Added a way to check if the file was interrupted during untaring or
	 not.
	-Added support for using custom CFLAGS if you'd like.
	-Added config.guess which buildcross.sh uses to change --build on
	 cross-compiles so gcc doesn't try setting build equal to host.
	-Added checks to see if each is already configured/installed or not.
	 This also fixes when gcc final is built so it doesn't remove the
	 contents if it's configured to build already.
