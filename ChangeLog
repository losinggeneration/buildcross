Version 1.0:
	-Initial release.

Version 1.1:
	-Some KOS fix-ups for generating the environ.sh file.

Version 1.2:
	-Added this file.
	-Changed the export PATH in Setup to include the newly installed
	 compiler first to use that instead of one that might be installed in a
	 path before that one.
	-Added support to try and use a cross compiler. I haven't been able to
	 get this to compile, but I don't think it's the scripts fault.
	-Added a way to check if the file was interrupted during untaring or
	 not.
	-Added support for using custom CFLAGS if you'd like.
	-Added config.guess which buildcross.sh uses to change --build on
	 cross-compiles so gcc doesn't try setting build equal to host.
	-Added checks to see if each is already configured/installed or not.
	 This also fixes when gcc final is built so it doesn't remove the
	 contents if it's configured to build already.

Version 1.3:
	-Added support for downloading sources if they aren't here instead of
	 just quitting. Still quits if unable to download files like one would
	 expect. Wget is needed for downloading Binutils, Gcc, and NewLib. SVN
	 is needed for getting KOS.
	-Moved some things around for easier reading of the code.
	-Added some comment formatting to make important comments stick out.
	-Changed some things about how kos is built. It also builds ports.
	-Added ix86 target.
	-KOS is built with the -dc command now

Version 1.3.1:
	-Fixed deadlocking bug in newlib patches.
	-Moved newlib-1.12.0-kos.diff to newlib-1.12.0.diff.

Version 1.3.2:
	-Fixed bug where it wouldn't patch after a download.
	-Did some simplifications to the Untar/UntarPatch functions.

Version 1.4:
	-Bumped Binutils to version 2.17.
	-Arm compiler for Dreamcast now builds without newlib and c++ by
	 default.
	-More than one patch can be applied by buildcross now. For more
	 information read README in patches directory.
	-Added -allc for building compiler and removing sources and objects
	 after each is built.
	-Added -dcc for building the dreamcast compiler, but it will clean the
	 source and objects after each is successfully built (If interrupted,
	 it will still resume where it left off. -c must be run to start over)
	-Added -i to rerun make installs even if .installed is found.
	-Remove's message now includes that it's removing .*config* and
	 .*installed*
	-Added examples for the two new options.
	-Changed manual DC build example to not include newlib and gcc final
	 for ARM.
	-Merged Setup function into SetupOptions (at end) since it's only
	 called after setting options anyways.
	-Fixed bug that might cause ix86 to not be able to be cross compiled.
	-Added patches/ix86 for completeness.
	-Added a kos patch which adds -R.stack to kos-objcopy if -O binary is
	 given in the command line. Patch disabled by default.
